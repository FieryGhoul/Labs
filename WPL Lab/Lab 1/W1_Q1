    <title>Whispers of the Wind</title>

    <p style="color:rgb(45, 53, 124)">
       <b>The leaves they dance, the leaves they fall</b>. The whisper of the wind. <br>
       <b>One more season, one more year.</b> The change, it now begins. <br>
       For many years, your presence felt. The trees prepare to sleep <br>
       As I wonder at your work, your voice begins to speak 
    </p>

    <p style="color:rgb(45, 53, 124)">
       The trees, they bow as you approach. Your power now displayed <br>
       I close my eyes and drift away, my thoughts of life replayed <br>
       Breaking through the whistling wind another I do hear <br>
       Who is this you’ve brought with you? Whose memories I hold dear 
    </p>
